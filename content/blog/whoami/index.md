Good morning,

My name is Andrey Lechev, but you can call me **Leechy**. I'm working as a frontend developer professionally since April 1st, 1999.

I'm good at HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the browsers. Not bad at some server stuff like Node.js, SQL, PHP, Pyton and [Parser](https://www.parser.ru/).

Right now I'm living in Luxembourg and working for [Reborn](http://reborn.lu) as a Senior Frontend Developer. My full work experience is available [on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leechy/).

I'm happy father of four kids: two girls and two boys (yes, I think that's important, because kids in the family are changing the life and four of them are enough to create a parallel reality). You can find a lot of family photos on my [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/andreykalechev).

You can contact me freely using any of the accounts listed on this page plus [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/andreykalechev) and [GitHub](https://github.com/leechy/). I'm not really a mail-guy, cause in the mail I have mostly spam, but if you want to, you can try anyway ;-))
