I'm not sure can I say that I started my blog in 2018 if it's almost December 31st ;-))

Actually, I was thinking to create a blog or at least to write couple of articles about what I'm doing right now, but I was too lazy to start... before I've red this Dan Abramov's tweet:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you feel like youâ€™ve learned something in the past few years I deeply recommend starting a blog, if only to catalog your thoughts.</p>&mdash; Dan Abramov (@dan_abramov) <a href="https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1079214023881707520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">30 December 2018</a></blockquote>
<br/>

Let's hope, I'll have enough time and will to go further than just this first post.

See you later.
